------------- **PROJECT #1** ------------- 

- Project Overview:

In this project, I will calculate the probability of the price of going up tomorrow for the S&P500 Index.

The method I am using in this project is called Random Forest, which is basically an ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees to make predictions and averages their outputs.

- Project Steps:

路 Download data using the yfinance package

路 Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy

路 Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy

路 Improve the accuracy of the model

- A Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code ---> [HERE](https://github.com/alfonsohdl/ahp/blob/main/rf_sp500_prediction.ipynb)

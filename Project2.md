------------- **PROJECT #2** -------------

- Project Overview:

In this project, I am using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Microsoft ($MSFT) stock price using scikit-learn and Keras.

A RNN is a class of neural networks specifically designed to work with sequential data, so they can capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.

- Project Steps:

· Download data using the yfinance package

· Build the RNN model

· Train the model

· Evaluate the model

· Make predictions and inverse transform predictions to original scale

· Plot the results

- A Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code ---> [HERE](https://github.com/alfonsohdl/ahp/blob/main/rnn_msft_prediction.ipynb)

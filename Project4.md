------------- **PROJECT #4** -------------

- Project Overview:

· In this project, I will calculate the probabilites, expected values and more statistical information needed to excel as a Poker player.

· In addition, I will show you the most optimal decisions when facing different situations at the Poker table.

· The goal is to learn the most optimal behaviour when playing, and by doing so, enriching your decision making process during the game.

- A Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code ---> [HERE](https://github.com/alfonsohdl/ahp/blob/main/poker_prob_and_stats.ipynb)

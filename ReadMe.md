############ - PROJECT #1 - ############

- Project Overview:

In this project, I will calculate the probability of the price of going up tomorrow for the S&P500 Index.

The method I am using in this project is called Random Forest, which is basically an ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees to make predictions and averages their outputs.

- Project Steps:

· Download data using the yfinance package

· Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy

· Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy

· Improve the accuracy of the model

- A Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code ---> [CODE](https://github.com/alfonsohdl/ahp/blob/main/rf_sp500_prediction.ipynb)

############ - PROJECT #2 - ############

- Project Overview:

In this project, I am using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Microsoft ($MSFT) stock price using scikit-learn and Keras.

A RNN is a class of neural networks specifically designed to work with sequential data, so they can capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.

- Project Steps:

· Download data using the yfinance package

· Build the RNN model

· Train the model

· Evaluate the model

· Make predictions and inverse transform predictions to original scale

· Plot the results

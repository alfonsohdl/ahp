------------- **PROJECT #1** ------------- 

- Project Overview:

In this project, I will calculate the probability of the price of going up tomorrow for the S&P500 Index.

The method I am using in this project is called Random Forest, which is basically an ensemble technique that builds multiple decision trees to make predictions and averages their outputs.

- Project Steps:

· Download data using the yfinance package

· Create an initial machine learning model and estimate accuracy

· Build a backtesting engine to more accurately measure accuracy

· Improve the accuracy of the model

------------- **PROJECT #2** -------------

- Project Overview:

In this project, I am using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict Microsoft ($MSFT) stock price using scikit-learn and Keras.

A RNN is a class of neural networks specifically designed to work with sequential data, so they can capture temporal dependencies in stock price data.

- Project Steps:

· Download data using the yfinance package

· Build the RNN model

· Train the model

· Evaluate the model

· Make predictions and inverse transform predictions to original scale

· Plot the results

------------- **PROJECT #3** -------------

- Project Overview:

In this project, I will calculate the present value of a series of future cash flows.

Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.

Present value allows investors to judge whether or not the price they pay for an investment is appropriate.

- Project Steps:

· Inputs: Cash flows at different time periods and interest rate.

· Calculate Present Value for each time period.

· Plot the Present Value graph.

· Print the numerical values of Cash Flows and Present Values.

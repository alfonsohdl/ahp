------------- **PROJECT #3** -------------

- Project Overview:

Â· In this project, I will calculate: 

* 1 - the present value of a series of future cash flows at times "t" (t=1,2,...,n) at r% per period.
  
* 2 - the future value at the end of "n" periods of a series of cash flows at %r interest rate.

* 3 - the calculations to find out if an hypothetical investment project is a potentially profitable project.

By doing so, we allow investors to judge whether or not the price they pay for an investment is appropriate.

------------- **PROJECT #3** -------------

- Project Overview:

· In this project, I will calculate the present value of a series of future cash flows.

· Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a specified rate of return.

· Present value allows investors to judge whether or not the price they pay for an investment is appropriate.

- Project Steps:

· Inputs: Cash flows at different time periods and interest rate.

· Calculate Present Value for each time period.

· Plot the Present Value graph.

· Print the numerical values of Cash Flows and Present Values.

- A Jupyter notebook that contains all of the code ---> [HERE](https://github.com/alfonsohdl/ahp/blob/main/time_value_of_money.ipynb)
